# Flutter Password Field
**(flutter_password_field)**

A small test of flutter building a PW widget that includes togglable visbility. Also includes email validation.

This is just the a form with two fields, nothing else is happening here! The password input is a widgte with local state for handling the toggle of the show/hide password icon.
